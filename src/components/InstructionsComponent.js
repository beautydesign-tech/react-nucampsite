    Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Inhale for a 5 count, focusing
    on inflating your stomach like a balloon filling with air. Hold in the
    breath for a 3 count. Then exhale as long as you can, emptying out the air,
    flattening your stomach as if you are emptying the balloon. Repeat 6-8
    times.
