      It is good to take moments throughout the day to stop and Check-In with
      yourself (and those around you).
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        Acknowledging how you are feeling not only helps you to be present, it
        also helps you reconnect with yourself so that when you get to the end
        of the day you do not have a stockpile of feelings weighing in as
        fatigue.
      </blockquote>
      Whether you are doing good, so so, or not well at all - Checking-In serves
      a purpose similar to a thermometer - simply a guage of the current climate
      - being aware of your inner world and how you are doing is important so
      that you can take a breather when you need it, preventing yourself from
      reaching overwhelm or getting stuck in an emotion.
